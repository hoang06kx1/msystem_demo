                M-system architecture was founded in Hong Kong by David McCormick RIBA ARB. David has designed some of Asias most prestigious projects and has 20 years experience in leading large multi-discipline teams on large complex projects working with such International firms as HOK (HK) Ltd, ALKF(HK),Travis Partners (Sydney), MoxleyJenner(UK), APP(UK). Davids international experience is distributed throughout the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and 15 years in Hong Kong, China, Thailand and Vietnam. M-system has established a strong regionally responsive studio with an emphasis on innovative and creative design. David was joined by ex Fosters & RMJM Design Architect James Atkinson ARB SAC renewing a partnership that extends back 10 years to the Hong Kong office of Urbanprojects Ltd where David was previously a director. With a background in Architecture, Msystem has expanded into Interior Design, with the addition of award winning Hong Kong Interior Designer Hermia Chan BIA UK. With years of shared experience working in the region the Directors, senior design and technical staff have an inherited framework for design methodology, management structure and technical support. International clients includes Louis Vuitton, Accor Novotel,Citroen, Landor(HK) Sun Group(Vn), HK Government, Lai Sun Group(HK) & Holiday Inn. Projects currently within the office include residential, retail, hospitality, commercial office and mixed-use developments throughout China, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. Many of our current secured projects have been won through design competitions against some of the worlds leading international practices. M-systems Directors take a key role in the projects from inception to completion, unlike other "International" consultants, we do not send inexperienced staff but attend all meetings and are therefore right on hand to make important Design and Technical decisions immediately without reporting back to senior management. ‘M-system continues to grow, with a new office in Da Nang Vietnam opened in August 2015, so developing further opportunities with new and existing clients In consideration of growing awareness and increasing demand for buildings to respond to the natural environment, M-system derives its architecture from an understanding of the many cultural influences of Asia, namely Fung Shui designs in China and Hong Kong, and Vaastu, from spiritual and environmental concepts in India. This knowledge has in turn enabled M-system to create a new and relevant architecture for the region. It reflects the role that climate and cultural setting can play in the built environment, building form, texture and technology. It does, and should, enhance the lives of the building occupants. "A contemporary architecture with a traditional base."
